# HelloCI
Practicing CI with Jenkins, Git, Docker
# Best practice:
#### 'Dev' branch always has the latest. Always sync up with 'dev' branch.
- Create a branch and work on your branch.
- When done, before merging to 'dev', pls create a Pull request.
- When a Pull request is approved -> merge it to dev.
